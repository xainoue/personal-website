      "A seemingly simple ice cream game about serving customers with a combat/adventure twist. I made this game in 2022 as a project for my middle school computer science class. It was my first real big project I had ever coded and introduced me to the possibilities ahead. I used p5.js to make the game.",

    description:
      "A simple game about serving customers in an ice cream shop. I made this game recently inspired by the ice cream adventure game I made in 2022, however making it much more simple due to the new programming tools I was learning to work with as well as the new challenges of designing my own assets. This was my second attempt at a bigger coding project not having picked up coding in a while. I used Python to make the game.",

      "An art piece I made in IbisPaint depicting a close up portrait of a person. I used this piece to study color and values by not directly color picking from a reference. It helped me improve my understanding in color theory and color contrasts that work well together.",
